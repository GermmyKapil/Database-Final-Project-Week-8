## ‚ö° Features & Objectives

- Design and implement a **relational database** using **MySQL**  
- Fully **normalized tables** with **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **constraints**  
- **Track library operations**: Authors, Books, Members, Loans  
- Practice **SQL queries**, **joins**, and **aggregation**

## üèõÔ∏è Database Schema

| Table   | Columns & Constraints |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Authors** | `AuthorID` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY<br>`FirstName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<br>`LastName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<br>`Country` VARCHAR(50) |
| **Books** | `BookID` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY<br>`Title` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL<br>`AuthorID` INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (`AuthorID`) REFERENCES Authors(`AuthorID`)<br>`Genre` VARCHAR(50)<br>`PublishedYear` YEAR |
| **Members** | `MemberID` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY<br>`FirstName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<br>`LastName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL<br>`Email` VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE<br>`Phone` VARCHAR(20) |
| **Loans** | `LoanID` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY<br>`BookID` INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (`BookID`) REFERENCES Books(`BookID`)<br>`MemberID` INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (`MemberID`) REFERENCES Members(`MemberID`)<br>`LoanDate` DATE NOT NULL<br>`ReturnDate` DATE |

**Relationships:**  
- Authors ‚Üí Books (1-to-Many)  
- Members ‚Üí Loans (1-to-Many)  
- Books ‚Üí Loans (1-to-Many)

## üíæ Deliverables

- `library.sql`  
  - `CREATE DATABASE` statement  
  - `CREATE TABLE` statements  
  - Primary and foreign key constraints  
  - Sample data for testing  

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (MySQL)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/library-management.git
cd library-management

# Log in to MySQL
mysql -u <username> -p

# Load database
SOURCE library.sql;

# Verify tables
USE library;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM Books;


---

üîé Sample Queries

List all books with authors


SELECT b.Title, CONCAT(a.FirstName, ' ', a.LastName) AS AuthorName
FROM Books b
JOIN Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;

Show which member borrowed which book


SELECT CONCAT(m.FirstName, ' ', m.LastName) AS MemberName, b.Title, l.LoanDate
FROM Loans l
JOIN Members m ON l.MemberID = m.MemberID
JOIN Books b ON l.BookID = b.BookID;

Count total loans per member


SELECT CONCAT(m.FirstName, ' ', m.LastName) AS MemberName, COUNT(l.LoanID) AS TotalLoans
FROM Members m
LEFT JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID;
